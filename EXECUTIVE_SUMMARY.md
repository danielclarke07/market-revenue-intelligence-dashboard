# Executive Summary (1 page)

## Objective
Create an Excel-based decision tool that converts raw order data into executive KPIs, segment insights, and a 12‑month forecast.

## What it answers
- Where do revenue and profit come from (region/channel/category)?
- Are discounts, shipping, or returns eroding profit?
- What happens to operating profit under Base/Best/Worst assumptions?
- What is the break-even point in orders and revenue?

## What to highlight in interviews
- The dashboard is filterable and auditable back to order-level rows.
- The “Highlights” panel surfaces the top region and top profit channel automatically.
- Forecast scenarios make it easy to discuss sensitivity and planning.

## Next upgrades (if you want to extend)
- Add customer cohort retention (repeat purchase rate by first purchase month).
- Add a pricing simulator (AOV and discount sensitivity).
- Add a simple inventory/fulfillment view (units, shipping cost trends).
